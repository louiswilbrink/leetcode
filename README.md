# My Leetcode Solutions

## To Run on command line

```
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npx tsx problem-name.ts
```

## To Debug in Chrome

```
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npx tsc --watch
$ open index.html
```

This will launch Chrome and execute `index.html`, which has of the compiled JavaScript files loaded in as `<script>` tags (yes, all problems are executed during every page reload, w/e).
